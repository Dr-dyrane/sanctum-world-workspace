# Handoff State

Purpose: enable a brand-new Claude session to resume accurately without stale assumptions.

## Where We Are

Project Sanctum onboarding is in Phase 1 World Building, but only steps 1-6 are in scope.

The Brainstorm for Korvin Merrow World has been completed, passed AutoQC, uploaded to RL Studio, and returned SEND BACK from Human Review.

RL Studio:

- Task ID: `cyau8803`
- Status: `Writer Actions / Start Plan Fixes`
- Brainstorm AutoQC: `51/51 passed`
- Human Review: SEND BACK from Stacey S

Current state: Brainstorm reviewer remediation has been prepared locally. World Spec drafting is not authorized.

## Locked Decisions

Locked from approved Brainstorm:

- Acute hospital medicine world, ED to inpatient admission.
- Multi-day hospitalization ending at Hospital Day 6 at 18:00 during discharge planning.
- Patient seed: 62-year-old male with T2DM, HTN, CKD stage 3, HFrEF, CAD, hyperlipidemia, anemia of CKD, osteoporosis/osteopenia from chronic steroid exposure, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, polypharmacy, PMR with prior chronic prednisone and recent taper.
- Presentation: AMS, progressive weakness, poor oral intake, reduced activity, borderline hypotension, AKI on CKD, possible urinary-source infection.
- Initial suspected sepsis treatment is appropriate.
- Complexity evolves from overlapping common hospital contributors, not from a single rare diagnosis.

Locked primary frictions:

1. Nephrology vs Cardiology.
2. Family vs Inpatient Medicine.
3. Emergency/Inpatient Medicine vs Endocrinology.

Locked world-level traps:

1. Steroid timeline/source-of-truth trap.
2. HF-AKI medication reconciliation and time-sensitive consultant trap.
3. Buried functional/cognitive status trap.
4. Sepsis anchoring after partial improvement trap.
5. Discharge plan source-hierarchy trap.

Approved rough task concepts:

1. Discharge medication reconciliation / medication safety review.
2. Hospital discharge summary generation.
3. Transition-of-care / discharge readiness plan.
4. Post-hospital follow-up assessment note.
5. Consultant recommendation synthesis / care coordination note.
6. Readmission risk / patient safety review.

Reserve only:

- Future ED reassessment after return visit.

Approved Brainstorm remediation additions:

- World Type: Typical Clinical World.
- Medication list: sacubitril/valsartan 24/26 mg BID; carvedilol 12.5 mg BID; furosemide 40 mg daily; spironolactone 25 mg daily; empagliflozin 10 mg daily; aspirin 81 mg daily; atorvastatin 40 mg nightly; metformin ER 500 mg BID; insulin glargine 18 units nightly; prednisone with inconsistent documented taper/dose; alendronate 70 mg weekly; calcium/vitamin D daily; ferrous sulfate 325 mg every other day; gabapentin 300 mg nightly.
- Active DOCX: `worlds/korvin-merrow/submission/Korvin_Merrow_Brainstorm.docx`.

## Decisions Remaining

Do not answer these without Alexander.

Identity/compliance:

- Confirm when to reupload the revised Brainstorm and rerun AutoQC.
- Synthetic MRN format.
- DOB, age consistency, sex, allergies, code status, height, weight, BMI, and clinically relevant demographics.

Clinical scenario:

- Exact calendar dates for ED arrival, admission course, world snapshot, and task anchors.
- Key milestone list.
- Source-of-truth hierarchy for conflicting evidence.

Task architecture:

- Consolidation from current rough mappings to 3-5 distinct approved catalog workflows.
- Whether/how to include a healthcare administration deliverable.
- Final task independence, requester, anchor, and one-deliverable discipline.

Traceability/file strategy:

- Evidence provenance workflow.
- Later file modalities.
- Later trap substrate planning.
- No final file inventory yet.

## Verified World Spec Risks

Use these as future World Spec priorities only after Brainstorm GO:

- AutoQC 2.2: patient name must be unmistakably synthetic.
- AutoQC 2.3: MRN must be clearly synthetic.
- AutoQC 2.14: Decision Friction Table required when 2+ conflicts exist.
- AutoQC 2.18 and 2.48: clinical facts and Expected Output facts must trace to narrative or file rows.
- AutoQC 2.41: temporal architecture is a blocker gate.
- AutoQC 2.65: source-of-truth hierarchy required when authority traps are present.
- AutoQC 2.98: workflow names must match approved tracker exactly.
- AutoQC 2.107: final world must use 3-5 distinct catalog workflows.
- AutoQC 2.108: typical clinical/medical director worlds should include clinical and healthcare administration work products where appropriate.

## Next Legal Action

Wait for Alexander authorization for RL Studio reupload.

If Alexander authorizes reupload:

1. Upload `worlds/korvin-merrow/submission/Korvin_Merrow_Brainstorm.docx`.
2. Rerun Brainstorm AutoQC.
3. Capture results locally before further edits.
4. Stop before final submit action unless explicitly authorized.

If Alexander requests more local review first:

1. Audit the current revised Brainstorm package.
2. Do not reupload until approved.
3. Do not begin World Spec.

## Hard Boundaries

Do not:

- draft the World Spec;
- populate the World Spec template;
- create Section 3 file inventory;
- create synthetic chart files;
- invent labs, vitals, medications, doses, dates, provider names, MRN, or patient name;
- write final task prompts;
- write golden responses;
- write grader guidelines;
- do failure analysis;
- change Brainstorm clinical content beyond reviewer-required remediation without Alexander approval.

## Current Best Claude Task

If asked to help now, Claude should only support preparation:

- summarize current state;
- audit against AutoQC v6.3;
- prepare interview questions;
- critique proposed physician decisions;
- help maintain consistency with the approved Brainstorm.
